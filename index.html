           Bruce Wayne grew up as the son of one of Gotham City’s most influential families. His early life was filled with privilege and comfort, until one tragic night changed everything. Losing his parents at a young age left a deep mark on him and shaped the rest of his life.

           That loss opened Bruce's eyes to the harsh reality of Gotham, a city full of crime, fear, and injustice. As he grew older, he carried the pain, loneliness, and anger with him, turning them into determination. He spent years training his body and mind, learning discipline, strategy, and understanding the nature of crime.
          </p>

          <p>As Bruce Wayne became Batman, he chose to protect Gotham from the shadows, using fear and discipline to fight crime where the law failed. Throughout his journey, he faced dangerous villains who embodied the city’s chaos, including the Joker with his twisted mind, the Riddler who challenged intelligence through deadly puzzles, the Penguin who controlled the underworld, and Two-Face who stood between justice and madness. Each encounter tested Batman’s limits, yet he remained a symbol of resistance, proving that even in Gotham’s darkest nights, someone is always watching.</p>
          <p>Behind the image of a successful businessman, Bruce Wayne represents resilience. Not through superpowers, but through intelligence, willpower, and an unbreakable commitment to stand against darkness.</p>
